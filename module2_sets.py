# sets are a type of collection
# sets are unordered: thus can't be accessed through index
# sets only have unique elements
# 

# set {"pop","rock"}
# even if there are duplicates when creating, once it has been created there will be no duplicates. 
# list to set by using set(list1)

# to add at the end
# set1.add("nc")
# can add same thing twice but nothing will happen
# set.remove("nc") : to remove an element

# verify by : 
# "nc" in set 
# true if it is in the set

# mathematical set operations

# set1 & set2 gives union of two sets OR use following
# set1.union(set2)

# set1.issubset(set2)
