# dictionary: use curly bracket
# keys are immutable and unique
# values can be mutable and duplicates
# each key and value is speerated by comma

# dict1.keys() this will give the keys
# dict1.values() will give values

# Verify the key is in the dictionary
# The Bodyguard' in release_year_dict

# dict_name.update({key: value})
# dict_name.clear()
# the clear method emties the dictionary and thus removes all key-value pairs within it.
